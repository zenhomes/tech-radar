                        <b>ADOPT</b> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale.
                        Technologies with a usage culture in our Vermietet.de production environment, low risk and recommended
                        to be widely used.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>TRIAL</b> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a real
                        problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL
                        technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organization walked this path and will
                        share knowledge and experiences.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>ASSESS</b> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us; technologies
                        worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS technologies
                        have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. You will find
                        some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote it, you may even find teams that
                        have started a prototyping effort.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>HOLD</b> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that we think
                        are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects,
                        but usually can be continued for existing projects.</li>
